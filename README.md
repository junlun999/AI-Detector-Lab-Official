# 🚀 AI Detect Lab: Professional AI Content Detector

**[Official Website: https://www.aidetectlab.com/](https://www.aidetectlab.com/)**

AI Detect Lab is a comprehensive toolkit designed to verify digital authenticity with 99.2% accuracy. We specialize in identifying advanced AI-generated content that standard detectors often miss.

## 🖼️ Why Our AI Image Detection is Superior

Most open-source detectors (like *CNNDetection*, *Spec*, *Dire*) are becoming outdated. 

### The Pain Point:
* **The Tech Gap:** While they can identify early GANs or basic Diffusion (SD 1.5), they struggle with the **'Domain Shift'** of modern generators.
* **DiT Challenge:** They fail to capture the subtle fingerprints of **DiT (Diffusion Transformer)** architectures used in **Flux.1 or Midjourney v6**.
* **Performance:** Academic models often take 30s+ to analyze one image. AI Detect Lab provides results in **seconds**.

## ✍️ Deep AI Text & ChatGPT Analysis

Beyond images, we provide 4-dimensional analysis for text to ensure academic and professional integrity:

1. **Multi-Model Support:** Specialized detection for **GPT-4o, GPT-5 (upcoming), Claude 3.5, and Gemini**.
2. **Structural Logic Analysis:** We don't just score; we analyze statistical distribution and tone patterns to catch human-like AI writing.
3. **Multilingual Capability:** Seamlessly handles both **English and Chinese** text detection.
